dollar-bill-frame
=================

This is my Parametric, OpenSCAD, Open Source (GPL v3), bill frame. Note I'm not sure if GPL v3 works for this type of work, so if not, I'll call it Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0. 

I recently finished making my first $100 so I decided to make a dollar bill frame to 3D print to hang on my wall. I'm still in alpha stages but I will be uploading the code for OpenSCAD soon. 

Oh and did I mention I'm 13?

I will be uploading four versions of the code as well as four different STLs:

Expert - Comments galore with variables and modules put into sections and sub-sections as organized by comments. Includes unit personalization so one can use other units other than mm (inches, centimeters, etc). Also includes feature to let the user customize the pronunciation of the frame shaping, customize the slit for the paperclip and more.
  
Deluxe - Comments explaining the variables, but no sectionining or comments on the modules. Still the same special features as Expert.

Full - Basic code with comment annotation but no modules (i.e all code is one piece). All variables still available.

Lite - Basic code with no modules, no unit change, no frame shape pronunciation, no custom slits and no comments. 

Most everything is done now. I'll be printing V0.8 soon and after that all that's left is to get someone to look over it to change some of the "play with this" type variables. After that, I'll make the different versions of the code.

Until next time,
Lucas
