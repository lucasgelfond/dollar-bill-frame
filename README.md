dollar-bill-frame
=================

This is my Parametric, OpenSCAD, Open Source (CC BY-SA 4.0), bill frame.

I recently finished making my first $100 so I decided to make a dollar bill frame to 3D print to hang on my wall. I'm still in alpha stages but I will be uploading the code for OpenSCAD soon. 

I will be uploading four versions of the code as well as four different STLs:

Expert - Comments galore with variables and modules put into sections and sub-sections as organized by comments. Includes unit personalization so one can use other units other than mm (inches, centimeters, etc). Also includes feature to let the user customize the pronunciation of the frame shaping, customize the slit for the paperclip and more.
  
Deluxe - Comments explaining the variables, but no sectionining or comments on the modules. Still the same special features as Version A.

Full - Basic code with comment annotation but no modules (i.e all code is one piece). All variables still available.

Lite - Basic code with no modules, no unit change, no frame shape pronunciation, no custom slits and no comments. 


I have just uploaded a V0.1 Alpha of Expert. I have to test this before I make the other. Note that there is no hook yet.  

On my todo list:
  Add a hook to the top of the frame (to attach with a pushpin to a bulletin board) 
  Make different versions
  Upload to Google Drive
  Test with OpenJSCAD
  Fix moving of tubes problem

Until the next edit,

Lucas
