dollar-bill-frame
=================

This is my Parametric, OpenSCAD, Open Source (GPL v3), bill frame. Note I'm not sure if GPL v3 works for this type of work, so if not, I'll call it Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0. 

I recently finished making my first $100 so I decided to make a dollar bill frame to 3D print to hang on my wall. I'm still in alpha stages but I will be uploading the code for OpenSCAD soon. 

I decided to come back to this because I remember it was unfinished. Just glancing at the code I'm a bit confused as it just doesn't make a lot of sense, and I feel like I've gotten a lot better at OpenSCAD and think I can get a complete, ground-up overhall in about an hour or two that's not buggy and will work just fine. Stay tuned.
